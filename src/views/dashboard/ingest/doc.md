### About InfluxDB Line Protocol

The general syntax of an InfluxDB Line Protocol data point is as follows:

```
<table>[,<tag_key>=<tag_value>[,...]] <field_key>=<field_value>[,<field_key>=<field_value>[,...]] [timestamp]
```

- `<table>`: The name of the Table.
- `<tag_key>=<tag_value>`: Tags provide metadata for the data point. They are optional but useful for filtering and grouping data.
- `<field_key>=<field_value>`: Fields represent the actual data values associated with the table.
- `[timestamp]`: Optional. If not provided, the server's current time will be used.

### Example

Let's say we want to write a data point representing CPU usage:

- Table: `cpu_usage`
- Tags: `host=server1,region=us-west`
- Fields: `usage_user=80,usage_system=10`

The Line Protocol for this data point would look like:

```
cpu_usage,host=server1,region=us-west usage_user=80,usage_system=10
```

If you want to include a timestamp (e.g., 1621401600000000000, which represents June 1, 2021, at 12:00:00 AM UTC), you can add it at the end:

```
cpu_usage,host=server1,region=us-west usage_user=80,usage_system=10 1621401600000000000
```
